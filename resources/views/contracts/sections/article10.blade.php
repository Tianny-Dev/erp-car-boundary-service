  Article 10 (Other Provisions)
</div>

<p>
    <strong>10.1. Entire AGREEMENT:</strong> This AGREEMENT contains the entire
    AGREEMENT between the PARTIES regarding this transaction. All prior oral or written
    discussions, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and draft Agreements between
    the PARTIES are superseded and rendered null and void. The PARTIES acknowledge
    that they have not relied on any representations or warranties made by the other party
    prior to the execution of this AGREEMENT, unless expressly incorporated into this
    AGREEMENT.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.2. Amendment to this AGREEMENT:</strong> Any amendment or modification to this
    AGREEMENT shall be effective only upon the written AGREEMENT of both PARTIES.
    No waiver by either party shall be effective unless expressly provided in writing, and
    no delay or failure by either party to exercise any provision shall constitute a waiver of
    that provision.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.3. Severability:</strong> If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held invalid or
    unenforceable by a local court or other competent authority, the remaining provisions
    shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision held invalid or unenforceable will be
    deemed replaced by a provision reasonably modified to reflect the PARTIES' original
    intent to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the PARTIES will cooperate to this
    end.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.4. Non-Assignment:</strong> Neither Party may assign or transfer any or all of its
    rights or obligations under this AGREEMENT to a Third Party without the prior written
    consent of the other Party. However, DDGNS may assign or establish a beneficial
    interest or security interest under this AGREEMENT to a financial institution for the
    purpose of performing a financial contract pursuant to project financing, and in such
    case, it will notify __________ in advance. Furthermore, __________ may perform
    some of its obligations under this AGREEMENT (such as vehicle operation obligations)through a sublease AGREEMENT with the driver, but this will not relieve DDGNS of its obligations under this AGREEMENT.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.5. Independent Contractors:</strong> The PARTIES are independent contractors in
    performing this AGREEMENT and will not be deemed to act on behalf of the other
    Party or as joint venturers. Nothing in this AGREEMENT shall be construed to
    constitute either Party as an agent, employee, or partner of the other Party.
    __________ is a separate legal entity independent from DDGNS, employing or
    contracting its own personnel (including drivers) to conduct operations. __________
    also assumes all legal liabilities related to its designated drivers, including taxes and
    social insurance.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.6. Notices:</strong> All official notices given by one Party to the other under this
    AGREEMENT must be in writing and delivered personally or sent by registered mail,
    certified courier, or email (if consented by the other party) to the address designated
    by the other party. Each Party's notice address is as follows, and any change in
    address must be notified in writing to the other party at least five days in advance.

    by courier, or upon the recipient's acknowledgement of receipt if sent by email.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:</strong> This AGREEMENT shall be
    construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.
    Should any dispute or disagreement arise in connection with this AGREEMENT, the
    PARTIES shall first endeavor to resolve it through amicable negotiation. Any dispute
    not resolved through negotiation shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    courts of competent jurisdiction located in Baguio City, Philippines, and shall be finally
    resolved therein. However, the PARTIES may, by written AGREEMENT, elect another
    dispute resolution method, such as international arbitration, in which case the agreed-
    upon procedures shall apply.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.8. Language of the AGREEMENT:</strong> This AGREEMENT may be drawn up in
    Korean and English, and both versions shall have equal effect. In the event of any
    conflict or inconsistency in interpretation between the two versions, the English version
    shall prevail. (The Korean version shall be considered a reference translation between
    the PARTIES, and signing and notarization may be based on the English version.)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.9. Future Cooperation:</strong> The PARTIES agree to cooperate in good faith with
    each other if additional documents or actions are required to achieve the purposes of
    this AGREEMENT. In particular, the PARTIES agree to sign additional contracts,
    confirmations, memoranda, etc. or provide information within a reasonable scope
    requested by financial institutions or government agencies. Furthermore, the PARTIES
    will actively communicate with each other to successfully promote the electric taxi
    business, and if revisions to the AGREEMENT are necessary to respond to changing
    market conditions or technological advancements, they will pursue them through
    consultation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>10.10. Reservation of Rights:</strong> All rights and powers not expressly granted in
    this AGREEMENT are reserved by DDGNS and __________, respectively. No delay
    or limitation by either Party in exercising any right it has against the other Party shall
    be construed as a waiver of that right or any other right.
